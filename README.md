This app was built with create-react-app, with additional packages: `redux`, `redux-saga`, `redux-logger`, `react-select`, `reselect`.

A proxy in `package.json` will allow our app to make the API calls.

The app's been left as-is in "development" config as the actions logged to console by `redux-logger` can be a big help to see what is currently in Redux store.

To run the app, simply:

`$ npm i;npm run start`
